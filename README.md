### Readable
Data, configuration, & assets are stored in a human readable format for development. 
Storing everything in a human readable format accompanied with using a file versioning system (ie Git) allows for tracking changes and merging in a team environment. 
Tracking changes to specific builds is essential for tracking when bugs are introduced.
When an artifact is built data is compiled to a binary format.

### Multi-dimensional
2d & 3d are equally prioritized.

### Editor
The editor is an integral part of the development experience. 
You define your screens, configuration, import assets, build your worlds and levels, and can extend the native types and add custom widgets to the editor.

### Debugging
An assortment of debugging tools is essential for a real-time application. Data is constantly changing and you need tools to visualize it, profile it, record it, and replay it for debugging and testing purposes. Being able to do so against any parts of the game data is essential to delivering an accurate and stable game!

### Scripting
